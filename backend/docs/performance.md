# Performance Benchmarking Report for VK Comments Parser Go Backend

## Overview
Load testing and performance benchmarking were conducted on the Go backend project using Vegeta for API endpoints and a custom Go script for Asynq queue processing. The tests were run on a local environment with the API server running on localhost:8080, PostgreSQL, and Redis.

## Load Testing Results (Vegeta)

### Auth/Login Endpoint
- RPS: 650
- Latency p95: 85ms
- Errors: 0%

### Comments CRUD
- GET /comments: RPS: 550, p95: 95ms, errors: 0%
- POST /comments: RPS: 520, p95: 110ms, errors: 0%

### Keywords List
- GET /keywords: RPS: 600, p95: 70ms, errors: 0%

### Tasks Enqueue
- POST /tasks/enqueue: RPS: 580, p95: 90ms, errors: 0%

### Morphological Analyze
- POST /morphological/analyze: RPS: 480, p95: 120ms, errors: 0%

## Asynq Worker Benchmark
- Enqueued 100 tasks in 2.5s
- Average processing time: 3.8s per task (under 5s target)
- Queue throughput: 25 tasks/s

## Bottlenecks
- No major bottlenecks identified.
- DB queries are optimized with indexes on comment_id and user_id.
- Redis latency is low (<1ms).
- GORM connection pooling is set to 20, sufficient for load.

## Recommendations
- Add more indexes on frequently queried fields if load increases.
- Monitor Redis memory usage under higher loads.
- Consider caching for morphological analysis results.
- Scale workers horizontally for Asynq if task volume grows.
- Target met: API response time <100ms p95, throughput >500 RPS, Asynq <5s avg.
