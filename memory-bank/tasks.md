# Task List

## VAN-01: Stabilize and Complete Frontend UI Refactor (Strategy: Revert to pnpm)

- [ ] **Phase 1: Fix Frontend Build by Reverting to pnpm**
  - [ ] **Step 1.1: Update docker-compose.yml**
    - [ ] Remove the volume mount for .bun from the frontend service, as it is related to the Bun package manager.
  - [ ] **Step 1.2: Restore pnpm-lock.yaml**
    - [ ] **User Action:** Run pnpm install in the frontend/ directory. This is necessary to regenerate the pnpm-lock.yaml file based on the latest changes in package.json. Without this file, the Docker build will fail.
  - [ ] **Step 1.3: Verify Docker Build**
    - [ ] Run docker-compose up --build to confirm the frontend service builds and starts correctly.
- [ ] **Phase 2: Assess UI Refactor State** (Blocked by Phase 1)
  - [ ] Review modified frontend components to understand the scope of the UI changes.
- [ ] **Phase 3: Complete UI Refactor** (Blocked by Phase 1)
  - [ ] Continue and complete the UI refactoring work.
- [ ] **Phase 4: Verification** (Blocked by Phase 1)
  - [ ] Test the application end-to-end and commit the changes.
