# Active Context: Frontend UI Refactor Analysis

**Current Branch**: feat/frontend-ui-refactor`n
**Status**: In Progress / **Broken**

## Key Findings (VAN Analysis)

1.  **Backend Refactoring Complete**: The backend has been successfully migrated to use **Poetry** for dependency management. The Docker setup is robust and follows best practices with multi-stage builds.

2.  **Frontend Refactoring Incomplete & Broken**: There is a major inconsistency in the frontend setup.
    -   The developer appears to have started migrating from **pnpm** to **Bun**.
    -   docker-compose.yml has been updated to use Bun (via a .bun volume).
    -   However, the frontend/Dockerfile is still configured for **pnpm** and references pnpm-lock.yaml, which has been deleted from the project.
    -   **Result**: The frontend service cannot be built using docker-compose, blocking all development and testing in a containerized environment.

## Immediate Goal

The primary goal is to **fix the frontend Docker build**. This involves aligning the frontend/Dockerfile with the new dependency manager, **Bun**. After the build is fixed, the UI refactoring work can be properly assessed and continued.
